# ⚠️ Inactive Fork

This fork is **no longer maintained** since I moved on to docker compose.
-- Please refer to the original repository for updates.
-- check docker hub for the app you try to set up
-- check the authors original website for docker instructions
-- check the authors community (discord/telegram)
-- check composerize.com to translate docker cli commands to docker compose (which equals portainer stacks code)
-- ask your fellow ai for help
-- feel free to open a post here if you can't make it run

# portainer-templates
These are some of the templates I use in portainer to manage my docker app stacks.



# Thanks!
Funkypenguin has been of great inspiration. 
I wouls like also to extend a warm thanks to Linuxserver.io for providing such good quality images.
